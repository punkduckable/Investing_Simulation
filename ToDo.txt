- Read in capital gains, dividend yield (both as %) for each month of data. This
is what should be stored in an object. Once I have this data, I can randomly
generate new months (with divided yields/capital gains).

- Write portfolio class. Should contain a stock, bond, and cash balance, as well
as stock %, bond %, deposit rate ($ put in for each month), and rebalancing
frequency (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 times per year). Also reinvestment rate (for
dividends)

- Write code to simulate a year. This will randomly sample 12 months. Inputs
should be a portfolio object. It will simulate a year of the stock market by
randomly sampling input data. Rebalance the portfolio's stock/bond balance
based on the returns, rebalance frequencies, reinvestment rate, and stock/bond
proportions. $ that isn't reinvested gets put into cash balance.

- Write a settings file + reader. There should be settings for time horizon,
initial balance, bond/stock proportion, rebalance frequency, deposit rate, and
reinvestment proportion.
